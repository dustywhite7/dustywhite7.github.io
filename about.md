### About Me

![](/assets/about.jpg)

That's me in the picture, along with my favorite people: my wife Mindy, our daughter Lily and our son Charlie. We just moved to Omaha, NE during the summer of 2016 so that I could start teaching at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I teach in the Department of Economics, and typically teach Business Analytics (BSAD 8700), Business Forecasting (ECON 8310), Tools for Data Analysis (ECON 8320), and Principles of Microeconomics (ECON 2200). My research is focused on the fields of Labor, Health, and Sports Economics as well as Industrial Organization.

#### My Background:

I studied as an undergraduate at Brigham Young University, where I majored in Economics. I took two years off from school to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in the Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sul. So if its easier for you, I am happy to correspond in Portuguese! :) After completing my undergraduate degree, I worked at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, UT for a year, where I became interested in health outcomes and gained a renewed affection for my Economics studies. This is now a major part of my research (see here).

I started work on my PhD in Economics at Washington State University in 2012, have worked on topics ranging from alcohol consumption and intercollegiate sports to the driving forces behind wage differentials for people choosing to work from home.
