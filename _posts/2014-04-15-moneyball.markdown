### Teaching Marginal Revenue Product Using **Moneyball**
Many students sign up for a sports economics course with the intention of learning the Moneyball process. We have developed an activity that allows students the opportunity to apply the Moneyball phenomenon using data from Major League Baseball and then participate in a player draft and simulated tournament structure. The project can also be incorporated into a labor economics or intermediate microeconomics course that teaches marginal revenue product. The paper also provides information on accessing a computer program that simulates the Major League Baseball playoff tournament. For more information, visit [www.MoneyballSimulator.info][moneyball]
