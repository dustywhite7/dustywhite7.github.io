### Improved grade outcomes with an e-mailed 'grade nudge'
Information provided at the moment a person makes a decision can influence behavior in predictable ways. The United Kingdom’s Behavioural Insights Team have used this idea to help improve the insulation of lofts, collect taxes, and even reduce litter. We developed software that appends a personalized message to each assignment in the class regarding the student’s current grade. This ‘grade nudge’ explains precisely how the assignment will impact the student’s final grade given their current standing in the class. Through a randomized trial, we show that the nudge improves student homework performance by about four percentage points.

### Findings
Our randomized trial suggests that the nudge improves student performance.
